# Online Fairness Auditing Algorithms

In this repository, we review the state-of-the-art fairness learning algorithms in an online setting. Here, I will present my understanding of a few papers from the literature to get an idea of the current research in this area. 
This is done as a part of my B.Tech Project supervised by Prof. Rachit Chhaya and Prof. Manisha Padala

## List of papers read to conduct literature review 

- [Auditing Fairness by Betting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17570) by *Ben Chugg et.al*
- [Online Fairness Auditing through Iterative Refinement](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3580305.3599454) by *Pranav Maneriker et. al*
- [Fighting the Fair Fight: An Overview of the Black-Box Fairness Auditing Techniques](https://shubhams.github.io/assets/pdf/wcp_blackbox_fairness_report.pdf) by *Shubham Singh*.  Note: This is a survey on heuristic algorithms for black-box fairness auditing in an offline setting. 
- [Auditing Black-Box Prediction Models for Data Minimization Compliance](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=Wkq4hKpGxWv) by *Bashir Rastegarpanah et. al*. Note: This focuses on data minimization compliance
